  /* 
    TASK 4
    In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
    1. If the 'new' keyword is used when calling the function, 'this' inside the function is a brand new object.
    2. If 'apply', 'call', or 'bind' are used to call a function, 'this' inside the function is the object that's passed in as an argument
    3. If the function is called as a method -- that is, if dot notation is used to invoke the function -- 'this' is the object that the function is a property of. In other words, when a dot is to the left of a function invocation, 'this' is the object to th left of the dot.
    4. If the function is invoked as a FREE FUNCTION INVOCATION, meaning it was invoked without any of the conditions present above, 'this' is the global object. In a browser, it's called 'window'.
